          testimonial="Being someone with the passion to learn design, I found it hard to multitask between my days job and my passion for learning. Coupled with this, the fear of learning alone without mentorship made me doubt my ability to learn ui/ux. However, thanks to Axia Africa and their mentorship programs, I have been able to learn what I desired to learn in a convenient space at my own pace. Thanks Axia Africa"
